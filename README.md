this is my journey towards implementing a full neural network from scrach, it involves aspects such as:
- machine learning knowledge
- OOP (object oriented programming)
- math (and its specifics algorithms)
- python (and its famous libraries)

the main objective is to create a functional usable neural network, both for classification task and also for regression!
the process involves one file that contains the perceptron architecture implemented, and the other a file containing the MLP.
